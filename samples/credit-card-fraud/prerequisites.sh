# Prerequisites for the credit-card-fraud sample.
#
# Usage:
#   ./prerequisites.sh <base-image>
#
# <base-image> must be an IBM Z Accelerated for TensorFlow production image, e.g.:
#   icr.io/ibmz/ibmz-accelerated-for-tensorflow:1.6.0
#
# The script builds a new container image with all dependencies pre-installed.
# A timestamped image tag is generated so re-running the script never
# overwrites a previously built image.
#
# After the build, the image tag and an example docker run command are printed.
# See the sample README for full instructions on running the sample.
#
# When you are finished with the sample, remove the workspace volume with:
#   docker volume rm tensorflow-ccf-workspace
