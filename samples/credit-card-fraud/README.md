# Credit Card Fraud Sample

The code sample in this directory uses the
[Credit Card Fraud data set](https://github.com/IBM/TabFormer/tree/main/data/credit_card)
and trains a model. A second script performs inference on the model with the
test data set and displays the results.

The [tensorflow README file](../../README.md) contains general information on
downloading and running the samples.

These samples will require first downloading the data set from the Internet and
extracting the archive.

## Running the Sample

Note that you will run these commands from inside the IBM Z Accelerated for
TensorFlow container.

First, train and save the model to disk with the `credit_card_fraud_training.py`
script. This will download the Credit Card Fraud data set and create a model in
the current directory.

Training will take some time. The epoch number in the output will indicate
progress.

```bash
python credit_card_fraud_training.py
```

Once the model has been trained, run the `credit_card_fraud.py` script to run
inference against the model.

```bash
python credit_card_fraud.py
```

The script will report a prediction for some sample transactions.
